It works on sigmoid function.
logistic is based on probability.
we need a hypothesis function or model.(sigmoid)
goal is to predict the likelihood that Y =1
output should be categorical nd there must exist a relation btw dependent variables.
Evaluation metrics:
    accuracy  (TP+TN/TP+FP+FN+TN)
    precision (correctly predicted +ve obs to total predicted +ve obs)(TP/TP+FP)
    Recall     (TP/TP+FN)
    F-measure  (2*P*R/P+R)
