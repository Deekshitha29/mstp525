machine learning is think by itself just by training the previous data(a computer program is said to learn from experince wrt to tasks)
3 types:1. supervised
        2. unsupervised  
        3. reinforced(under development)
what isartifical intelligence,machine learning,and deep learing 
ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE: artifical intellingce (AI) is the science of making things smart( "human intelligence exhibited by machines")
common cases in AI: . sound detection 
                    . OBJECT DETECTION
                    . natural language processing/ sentiment analysis
                    . creative(like style transfer)
                    . prediction-(give some inputs,what is expected o/p for unseen examples)
                    . translation b/w languages
                    . restoration/transformation
MACHINE LEARNING: " an approch to achieve AI through s/m that can learn from experience to find patterns is set of data"(ML is hot new thing)
DEEP LEARNING:"a technique for implementing machine learning".
classical programming vs machine learning
classical(inputs- data,rules;output- answers)
ML(inputs- data,anwers;output-rules)

TYPES OF VARIABLES:(NUMBERS,DATES AND STRING)
                1. NUMERICAL(MADE OF NUMBERS-AGE,WEIGHT)
                     * CONTINUOUS(INFINTE OPTIONS- AGE, WEIGHT,AND BLOOD PRESSURE)
                     * DISCRETE(SHOE SIZE,NO OF CHILDREN)
                2. CATEGORIAL(MADE OF WORDS- EYECOLOR,GENDER,BLOOD TYPE)
                     * ORDINAL(DATA HAS A HIERARCHY- PAIN SEVERITY,MOOD)
                     *NOMIAL(DATA HAS NO HIERARCHY- EYECOLOR,DOG BREED AND BLOOD TYPE)
                     
***  MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS:
         1. GET DATA
         2. CLEAN,PREPARE & MANIPULATE DATA
         3. TRAIN MODEL
         4. TEST DATA
         5. IMPROVE
packages for ML in python:
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn
  * pandas
  * tensorflow
  * theano
  * numpy
 
FEATURES / ATTRIBUTES
 . FEATURES(AKA attributes) are used to train Ml system. They are the properties of the thing you are gng to learn
 . choosing useful features can have a big impact on the quality of the system.

HOW ML SYSTEM TRAINED
 * SUPERVISED LEARNING(CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM)
 * SUPERVISED LEARNING(CLUSTERING ALGORITHM)
 * REINFORCEMENT
 
 
MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS:
 Supervised:
     *Regression
           Linear regression
           logistic regression
           polynomail regression
     *Classification
           >Linear Classifiers
               Logistic regression
               Naive Bayes classification
           >Nearest neighbour
           >Support vector machine
           >Decision trees
           >Random forest
           
 Linear regression (relationship should be linear)
 -train
 -test
 -fit
 -predict
 -score
 -coefficient of determination
Polynomial regression(relationship curve)
-train
-test
-split
-transform
-fit
Ridge,loso,elastic net
